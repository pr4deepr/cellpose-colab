## Running cellpose and colab on local conda installation

This is mainly if you'd like to train data using your PC resources
Installation instructions are provided in the notebook below. The _cellpose_colab_local.yml_ file provided here is only for **upgrading** the existing cellpose environment.
Check the notebook below for more info.
